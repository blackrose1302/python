Lists vs. Sets

-----------------------
Lists 
_______________________

1. ordered list
2. mutable
3. allow duplicate elements
4. Use lists when you need an ordered collection with the ability to modify elements


------------------------
SETS
------------------------

1. unordered
2. mutable
3. no duplicate elements
4. Use sets when you need an unordered collection of unique elements, and you want to perform set operations like union, intersection, and difference.

-------------------------
OPERATIONS
------------------------

1. Adding Elements
   append() or insert() #list
   add() #set

2. Removing Elements
    remove(), pop() or del()  #list
     remove() or discard()    #set

-----------------------------------
Choosing Between Lists and Sets
-----------------------------------

1. Use Lists When:

You need to maintain the order of elements.
Duplicate elements are allowed.
You need to access elements by index.


2. Use Sets When:

Order doesn't matter.
You want to ensure unique elements.
You need to perform set operations like union, intersection, or difference.
