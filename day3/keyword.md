Every language contains words and a set of rules that would make a sentence meaningful.
Similarly, in Python programming language, there are a set of predefined words, called Keywords which along with Identifiers will form meaningful sentences when used together.
Python has a set of keywords that are reserved words that cannot be used as variable names, function names, or any other identifiers.

Here is some majorly used keywords:

1. and -- logical operator that returns True if both operands are true.
2. or -- logical operator that returns True if at least one of the operands is true.
3. not --  logical operator that returns the opposite of the operand's truth value.
4. if -- start a conditional statement and is followed by a condition that determines whether the code block is executed.
5. else -- used in conjunction with if to define an alternative code block to execute when the if condition is False.
6. elseif -- used to check additional conditions after an if statement and is used in combination with if and else.
7. for -- used to create a loop that iterates over a sequence (such as a list, tuple, or string) and executes a block of code for each item in the sequence.
8. while -- used to create a loop that repeatedly executes a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.
9. in -- Used with for, it checks if a value is present in a sequence.
10. try -- beginning of a block of code that is subject to exception handling. It is followed by except to catch and handle exceptions.
11. except -- Used with try, it defines a block of code to execute when an exception is raised in the corresponding try block.
12. finally -- Used with try, it defines a block of code that is always executed, whether an exception is raised or not.
13. def -- used to define a function in Python
14. return -- used within a function to specify the value that the function should return.
15. class -- used to define a class, which is a blueprint for creating objects in object-oriented programming.
16. from -- Used with import to specify which specific components from a module should be imported.
17. import -- used to import modules or libraries to access their functions, classes, or variables.
18. as -- Used with import to create an alias for a module, making it easier to reference in the code.
19. True -- represents a boolean value for "true."
20. False -- represents a boolean value for "false."
21. None -- represents a special null value or absence of value.
22. is -- used for identity comparison, checking if two variables refer to the same object in memory.
23. lambda -- used to create small, anonymous functions (lambda functions).
24. with -- used for context management, ensuring that certain operations are performed before and after a block of code.
25. global -- used to declare a global variable within a function's scope.
26. nonlocal -- used to declare a variable as nonlocal, which allows modifying a variable in an enclosing (but non-global) scope.
