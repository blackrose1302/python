## commmand line arguments ##

The arguments that are given after the name of the program in the command line shell of the operating system are known as Command Line Arguments
We usually pass these values along with the name of the Python script.
we execute the following command in the command prompt terminal of the operating system.
The three most common are: 

Using sys.argv
Using getopt module
Using argparse module

1. Using sys.argv -- provides functions and variables used to manipulate different parts of the Python runtime environment. 
 Itâ€™s main purpose are:

It is a list of command line arguments.
len(sys.argv) provides the number of command line arguments.
sys.argv[0] is the name of the current Python script. 

2. Using getopt module -- it is required to remove the first element from the list of command-line arguments. 

3. Using argparse module -- it provides a lot of options such as positional arguments, default value for arguments, help message, specifying data type of argument.

## Environment Variables in Python ##

there are fixed number of env variable in pyton, but we can create our own env variable as well as.

export password = "qwertgfd"  ## this is added to env variable in python.

now we can use this any python script to extract the value and use it by using "os" module.
